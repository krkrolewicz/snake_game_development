<b>Snake game<b>

This repo stores development code of snake game.

Although snake is one of the oldest and most classic games of gaming history, it still serves as one of the greatest opportunities to learn
algorithmics, programming and logical thinking. This repo serves its author in exactly that way.

First step is to create a working instance of snake game. It should work in a constant, unstopped way, presenting all of the features of classic snake. Thus, the snake should
move constantly, turn on request by the user, collect food and extend its length after eating.

As of 19th of March 2025, the snake of this repo is partly operational. The snake reacts to movements, but does not move all the time. The game
still does not support food collection by the snake, although the files are prepared. All necessary edits for that purpose will be 
hopefully completed in the near future after creation of new branch.

After completing the snake game, it is intended to implement any kind of reinforcement learning to the snake in order to learn the algorithm steer the snake
in order to maximise the score gained in the game.

Repo creation date: 19th of March 2025
